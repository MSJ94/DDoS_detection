# DDoS Detection in SDN

Software Defined Networking (SDN) emerged out as an alternative of the traditional network now a days. SDN provides a centralized control of the network. The controller is also a single point of failure in the SDN environment. This project focusses on detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), identifying the source of the attack and mitigating the attack in the SDN. 

#### Requirements
 - Floodlight controller (https://floodlight.atlassian.net/wiki/display/floodlightcontroller/Installation+Guide)
 - Mininet (For creating network with OpenVSwitch) (http://mininet.org/download/)
 - Hping3 (Tool for creating packet in Linux)
 - Eclipse (IDE for Java) (optional)

#### Description 
The project works with Floodlight acting in 'hub' mode i.e. all the packets are transmitted from the switch to the controller.
The module consists of two classes :
 - **CDM** (Collection,Detection and Mitigation) class for collecting data and running the detection algorithm every 15 sec and finally running the mitigation process if any attack is detected.
 - **Server** class for storing the server IP and the host associated with the server.
##### Collecting data
When any packet arrives at the controller, source and destination IP address are extracted from the packet.If any of the IP address belongs to the server under consideration, then the packet is further processed otherwise it is left.
Then after that information about the TCP flag is extracted from the packet and is updated to the appropriate host associated with server. 

##### Detection Algorithm
A thread is created which runs in every 15 seconds and collect the count of SYN , SYN-ACK and FIN flag of TCP for every host and server pair and calculate the entropy using the following formula:

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [keymaster.js] - awesome keyboard handler lib by [@thomasfuchs]
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Download and extract the [latest pre-built release](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/releases).

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ npm run predeploy
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins

* Dropbox
* Github
* Google Drive
* OneDrive

Readmes, how to use them in your own application can be found here:

* [plugins/dropbox/README.md] [PlDb]
* [plugins/github/README.md] [PlGh]
* [plugins/googledrive/README.md] [PlGd]
* [plugins/onedrive/README.md] [PlOd]

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma start
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 80, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
npm run-script build-docker
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Moreover, this uses a _hack_ to get a more optimized `npm` build by copying the dependencies over and only installing when the `package.json` itself has changed.  Look inside the `package.json` and the `Dockerfile` for more details on how this works.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 80 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:latest
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud

See [KUBERNETES.md](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/blob/master/KUBERNETES.md)


#### docker-compose.yml

Change the path for the nginx conf mounting path to your full path, not mine!

### N|Solid and NGINX

More details coming soon.


### Todos

 - Write Tests
 - Rethink Github Save
 - Add Code Comments
 - Add Night Mode
